"""
Deterministic PSIRT priority scoring.

Priority starts from a CVSS band (or Fortinet's own severity label when no
CVSS score was extracted), then is forced to at least "high" if the
advisory text states exploitation or the CVE is CISA KEV-listed — a
vulnerability being actively exploited outranks a merely high CVSS score.
A zero-exposure fleet always scores "informational" regardless of
severity, since there is nothing to act on.
